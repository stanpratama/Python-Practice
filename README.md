## Rock Paper Scissors

`rps_vs_comp.py` and `rps_two_players.py`

Simple "Best 2 out of 3" rock paper scissors game where you can play against your friends or against computer with replay mechanism and safety mechanism to prevent input error from user.

Things Learned:

1. Very Basic Python: Assigning variable, create and manipulate user input.
2. Conditional Logic: to determine the winner based on user or computer choice.
3. Loop: make replay mechanism and preventing user from using irrelevant input.

This file stored all dictionary practice from the course, from making simple dictionary to nested and dictionary comprehension.

## Set and Tuples Practice

`set_and_tuples_practice.ipynb`

This file stored very simple set and tuples practice from the course.

## Functions Practice

`function_practice.ipynb`

This files contain all 22 practice from Functions section, focusing on general function, its parameter and argument, scope, *args and **kargs.

## Built-In Function Practice

`built_in_function_practice.ipynb`

This files stored all built in function exercise such as lambda, filter, map, any/all, sorted, reversed, min/max, abs/sum/round, zip function.

## Modules
